# LOL_Classification

### Introduction

This is a very trial for learning SVM in OpenCV. In this project, I try to classify two types of images, one is Anny's while the other is Leesin's, by using SVM.

For more detail, you may review the code. I am too lazy to write the readme file. I am very sorry for that.
